This is my portfolio built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  My hope is to connect with all sorts of people who are interested in programming and share my story.  Though there are tons of different solutions for creating a portfolio, there is something about creating things from scratch that I really enjoy and love so I decided to do that for myself.

## Journey
My story for learning how to code started with a curious opportunity.  I was in my thirties working as a salesman for a women's clothing company.  The business needed a website but no means to really build one so I just went home one day and searched on Google, "how to make a website."  I didn't end up making a website for our company, but I did have a lot of fun learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€“the building blocks for any website.  Once I rendered "Hello, World" on my browser it was love at first sight.

I grew up playing Starcraft as a kid and I remember my dream job was to be a e-sports pro gamer like 'Slayers'_Boxer, lol.  I would obsess about build strategies and learn every detail of the game to improve my skills and compete.  That's what coding did for me over a decade later.  Coding made me feel like a kid again, allowing me to compete against myself, obsess over the learning, and produce results.  And, as I was teaching myself to code, I learned that you can make a career out of it.  Well, that was it for me.

## Building and Learning Process
Creating my first portfolio from scratch was a challenge!  Not just how to code but also how everything connects to each other over the internet, like servers/clients, hosting, HTTP requests, DNS, how to set up my own URL address, and all that fun stuff.  Here is a list of things that needed to be true for me so that this website could exist:

- purchase a cheap domain name so I can have a cool URL address
	- setting up DNS provider stuff: `CNAME`, `A`, nameservers...
- set up a custom domain name for GitHub pages
- set up secured HTTP and learning the difference between HTTP and HTTPS
- learn VSCode
- learn semantic HTML basics
  - learn about Google Analytics and their search ranking stuff
  - when people search for my name, I want the results to show at the top!
  - accessibility is a big priority
  - metadata description so my shared link looks awesome and cool
- learn CSS basics so I can center stuff, zomg!
- learn JavaScript basics so I can click and open my hamburger menu, oh yeah!
- learn git flow basics, wtf?
- curate some images, copy, social media, documentation, and design layout...

## Outcomes
I am continuously learning more advanced programming concepts and exploring creative business solutions.  Ultimately, I want to make my impact by helping businesses and individuals create digital products that change lives.  This website marks the beginning of my coding jorney and I am proud to have built it from the ground up.  I am excited to keep learning more and adding to a strong foundation so that I can be excellent for those I serve in the present and future.
